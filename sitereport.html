        <h2>My Learning Experience</h2>

        <p>
            Building this portfolio website has been a valuable learning experience for me during the CSY1063 module.
            At the beginning of the module, I had very limited knowledge of web development and found HTML and CSS
            difficult to understand. Over time, by practicing and making mistakes, I gradually became more confident
            in creating web pages and styling them.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the first challenges I faced was understanding how to structure multiple HTML pages and link them
            together using a navigation menu. At first, some links did not work correctly, but fixing these issues
            helped me understand how file paths and page linking work. I also learned how to use CSS to control layout,
            colors, spacing, and fonts, which made a big difference in the appearance of the website.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the design of the website, I decided to keep it simple and clean. I used light purple, white, and black
            colors to ensure good readability and a calm user interface. I did not use complex animations or advanced
            features because my focus was on learning the basics and keeping the website beginner-friendly. I was
            inspired by simple portfolio websites that focus on clarity and ease of use.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another challenge during development was debugging layout and alignment issues. Sometimes sections did not
            look balanced or spaced correctly. By adjusting margins, padding, and section widths, I learned how small
            CSS changes can significantly improve the layout and overall user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            All HTML and CSS files were validated using online validation tools, and screenshots of the validation
            results are included on this page. A video demonstration explaining the website and its features is also
            provided at the following link:

            </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this project helped me build a strong foundation in web development and increased my confidence in
            using HTML and CSS for future projects.
